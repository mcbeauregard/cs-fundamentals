1. What is a hash table?
> Answer:
A hash table is a type of data structure that stores values, linking each one to unique key, which then forms a key-value pair, similar to the firebase database we created back in Module 2. You can look up data via the unique key, then returning the value. Each hash table can store the key-values in an array. You should use a hash table when your data contains a variable number of consistently formatted values.

2. What is hashing?
> Answer:
Hashing handles the conversion in a hash table. It does this by converting data to a numerical index. Then the hashing function is used to assign the unique hash code to a fixed length. Once this is done, the hash table can match the key-value to it's internal array.

3. How does a hash table store data?
> Answer:
You use hash tables to store similar groups of data by "some form of identifier," such as an ID number.

4. How are hash tables and objects different?
> Answer:
Hash tables group similar type of data, where as objects can hold varying types of data together. This is important to note, since developers will need to decide which one is the best one for them to use based on their data.

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
> Answer: **

function customerData(phoneNumber, customer){
  CREATE hashCustomerData
  STORE each entry(key) with customer into customerData
  CHECK whether customerData contains phoneNumber
}
...
function createNote(note, newspaper){
  CREATE HashMapNote
  CREATE HashMapNewspaper
  STORE each word(key) with note into HashMapNote and associate with frequency (value)
  STORE each word(key) within newspaper into HashMapNewspaper and associate with frequency (value)
  CHECK whether HashMapNewspaper contains HashMapNote
}
