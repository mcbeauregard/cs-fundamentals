Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
> Answer:
It's an informal language that helps developers create an algorithms - you use to help you express the code you want to write without using a formal language.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
> Answer:
It would not run because pseudocode can be read by people, not computers.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

> Answer:

FUNCTION isNumberGreater
INPUT first number and second number
  IF the first number is greater than the second number
    PRINT first number
  ELSE
    PRINT second number
  END IF
END FUNCTION

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

> Answer:

FUNCTION printOutNumbers
  SET total index to 1
    PRINT index and go to new line
    INCREMENT number
END FUNCTION

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

> Answer:

FUNCTION find
  INIT total to 0
  INPUT contacts
  WHILE the contacts is not 0
    INPUT a name
    RETURN entry
  END WHILE
END FUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

> Answer:

var contacts = [
          {firstName: "Adam", number: "604-912-4444"},
          {firstName: "Amy", number: "604-777-2222"},
          {firstName: "Joe", number: "604-123-4567"},
          {firstName: "Mandy", number: "604-123-0000"},
          {firstName: "Pierce", number: "604-546-1234"}];

function find(firstName) {
  for(i = 0; i <= contacts.length; i++) {
    if (firstName === contacts[i].firstName) {
      return contacts[i];
      }
    }
  };

console.log(find("Adam"));
