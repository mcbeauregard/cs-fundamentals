Exercises

1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?
> Answer:
The main difference is how they arrange their data structures. Stack arranges data in a LIFO (last-in-first-out) priority. Whereas Queue, arranges data in a FIFO (first-in-first-out priority). Stack also uses a push and pop method, for it's data, which is not used in a Queue as it's a "commonplace data structure."

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?
> Answer: **
 Both stacks and queues prioritize entries.

3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?
> Answer:
- For the UNDO option I would use a FIFO data structure, so I would use Queue because the UNDO option is taking your most recent action and repeating it, so you want it to undo your first action.
- For the REDO option I would use a LIFO data structure, using Stack because the REDO option takes your last action puts it in a queue to be called, which is always before the next queued item. 

Programming Questions
You may program the following question in any language of your choice. Before you begin coding, write out a plan as to how you will solve the question.

1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".
> Answer:

2. Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

  To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.

  CLASS Stack
   FUNCTION pop(queue)
     ...fill in pseudocode here
   END FUNCTION
  END CLASS

> Answer:

3. Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).

  CLASS QUEUE
   FUNCTION enqueue(element)
     ...fill in pseudocode here
   END FUNCTION

   FUNCTION dequeue
     ...fill in pseudocode here
   END FUNCTION
  END CLASS
